## What is mushroom ?

Mushroom is a collection of cards for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] Lovelace UI.

Mushroom mission is to propose easy to use components to build your [Home Assistant][home-assistant] dashboard.

### Features

-   🛠 Editor for **all cards** and and **all options** (no need to edit `yaml`)
-   😍 Icon picker
-   🖌 Color picker
-   🚀 0 dependencies : no need to install another card.
-   🌈 Based on Material UI colors
-   🌓 Light and dark theme support

The goal of Mushroom is not to provide custom card for deep customization. You can use the excellent [UI Lovelace Minimalist][ui-lovelace-minimalist] and [Button card][button-card] plugins for this.

## Installation

### HACS

Mushroom is available in [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store).

      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources Tab, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/mushroom.js
              type: module
        ```

If you want more information about themes, check out the official [Home Assistant documentation about themes][home-assitant-theme-docs].

## Development server

### Home assistant demo

You can run a demo instance of Home Assistant with docker by running:

```sh
npm run start:hass
```

Once it's done, go to home assitant instance [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) and start configuration.

### Development

In another terminal, install dependencies and run development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Server will start on port `5000`.

### Home assistant configuration

Once both Home Assistant and mushroom are running, you have to add a resource to Home Assistant UI:

-   Go on your profile
-   Enable `Advanced mode`
-   Then go to Lovelace resources
-   Add the ressource `http://localhost:5000/mushroom.js`:

    _Configuration_ → _Lovelace Dashboards_ → _Resources Tab_ → Click Plus button → Set _Url_ as `http://localhost:5000/mushroom.js` → Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.

### Build

You can build the `mushroom.js` file in `dist` folder by running the build command.
