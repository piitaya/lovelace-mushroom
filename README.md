## What is mushroom ?

Mushroom is a collection of cards for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] Dashboard UI.

Mushroom mission is to propose easy to use components to build your [Home Assistant][home-assistant] dashboard.

### Features

-   🛠 Editor for **all cards** and and **all options** (no need to edit `yaml`)
-   😍 Icon picker
-   🖌 Color picker
-   🚀 0 dependencies : no need to install another card.
-   🌈 Based on Material UI colors
-   🌓 Light and dark theme support
-   🎨 Optional theme customization
-   🌎 Internationalization

The goal of Mushroom is not to provide custom card for deep customization. You can use the excellent [UI Lovelace Minimalist][ui-lovelace-minimalist] and [Button card][button-card] plugins for this.

## Installation

### HACS

Mushroom is available in [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store).

1. Install HACS if you don't have it already
2. Open HACS in Home Assistant
3. Go to "Frontend" section
4. Click button with "+" icon

### Manual

1. Download `mushroom.js` file from the [latest-release].
2. Put `mushroom.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `mushroom.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ → _Dashboards_ → _More Options icon_ → _Resources_ → _Add Resource_ → Set _Url_ as `/local/mushroom.js` → Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/mushroom.js
              type: module
        ```

All the Mushroom cards can be configured using Dashboard UI editor.

### Theme customization

Mushroom works without theme but you can add a theme for better experience by installing the [Mushroom Themes](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom-themes). If you want more information about themes, check out the official [Home Assistant documentation about themes][home-assitant-theme-docs].

## Development server

### Home assistant demo

You can run a demo instance of Home Assistant with docker by running:

```sh
npm run start:hass
```

Once it's done, go to Home Assistant instance [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) and start configuration.

#### Windows Users

If you are on Windows, either run the above command in Powershell, or use the below if using Command Prompt:

```sh
npm run start:hass-cmd
```

### Development

In another terminal, install dependencies and run development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Server will start on port `4000`.

### Build

You can build the `mushroom.js` file in `dist` folder by running the build command.

```sh
npm run build
```

### Maintainer steps to add a new language

1. To be compatible with Home Assistant, language tags have to follow [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47). A list of most language tags can be found here: [IANA subtag registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). Examples: `fr`, `fr-CA`, `zh-Hans`.
2. Create a new file `{language_code}.json` with your language code in the [translation folder](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/tree/main/src/translations). Examples: `fr.json`.
3. Import your file into the [`localize.ts file`](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/src/localize.ts) and add your language in the `languages` record.
4. Don't forget to test locally with the development server by choosing the language with the Home Assistant UI in your profile.
